Coding Standards for BattleSysAlpha
General Guidelines

    Indentation: Use 2 spaces per level.
    Comments: Write clear and concise comments for each function and complex code block. Use ASCII formatting to separate sections.
    Naming: Use meaningful but concise names for variables and functions (e.g., playerScore instead of ps or playerTotalScore).

Code Structure

    Functions: Keep functions short and focused, ideally no longer than 20-30 lines.
    Grouping: Group related functions together and place them in logical order.
    Core Functions: Use setup() for initialization and draw() for continuous execution.

Best Practices

    Magic Numbers: Avoid magic numbers; use constants or descriptive variables.
    Loops: Optimize loops to minimize unnecessary computations.
    Error Handling: Handle potential error cases, especially in I/O operations.

Readability

    Whitespace: Use whitespace to separate logical blocks of code.
    Consistency: Follow consistent naming and code formatting conventions.

Documentation

    Docstrings: Include docstrings for all classes and functions, detailing their purpose, parameters, and return values.
    Inline Comments: Use inline comments sparingly to explain non-obvious code segments.
