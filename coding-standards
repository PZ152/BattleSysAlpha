# Coding Standards for Processing 4.0

## General Guidelines
- Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 spaces per level).
- Write clear and concise comments for each function and complex block of code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.

## Code Structure
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
- Group related functions together.
- Use `setup()` and `draw()` functions effectively.

## Best Practices
- Avoid using magic numbers; use constants or variables with descriptive names.
- Optimize loops to reduce unnecessary computations.
- Handle all potential error cases, especially in input/output operations.
